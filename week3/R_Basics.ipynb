These `functions` were developed (i.e. coded or written) by \"community members\" that usually develop them to solve their own problems, but that also don't mind sharing their `functions` with the rest of the world. \n",
    "3. **Your own** `functions`: Yes! you can make your own functions (we'll learn how to that later). This is the essence of \"code reutilization\". If you find yourself re-writting over and over very similar code, you can pack that code in a `function` so that the next time, you can simply \"execute\" your `function`.\n",

    "2. Before the parentheses is the **Function name**, which may or may not have a \"dot\" in between. Function names often refer to what the function does. For example, the function `print` prints text to the screen.\n",
