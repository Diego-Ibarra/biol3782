    "# What are `dplyr` and `tidyr`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The package `dplyr`provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database, and only the results of the query are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package `tidyr` addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups (e.g., a time period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number). Moving back and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and `tidyr` gives you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The experiment \n",
    "We conducted an experiment to evaluate the cummulative effects of drought and disease on the silver tree. We measured physiological responses of the plant such as photosynthetic oxygen evolution and electrical conductivity.\n",
