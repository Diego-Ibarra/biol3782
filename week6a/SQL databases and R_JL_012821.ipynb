    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What to do about very large datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have dealt with small datasets that easily fit into your computer's memory. But what about datasets that are too large for your computer to handle as a whole? In this case, storing the data outside of R and organizing it in a database is helpful. Connecting to the database allows you to retrieve only the chunks needed for the current analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even better, many large datasets are already available in public or private databases. You can query them without having to download the data first.\n",
    "\n",
    "R can connect to almost any existing database type. Most common database types have R packages that allow you to connect to them (e.g., RSQLite, RMySQL, etc). Furthermore, the dplyr package, in conjunction with dbplyr, supports connecting to the widely-used open source databases sqlite, mysql and postgresql, as well as Google’s bigquery, and it can also be extended to other database types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dplyr package now has a generalized SQL backend for talking to databases, and the new dbplyr package translates R code into database-specific variants. As of this writing, SQL variants are supported for the following databases: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Amazon Redshift, Apache Hive, and Apache Impala. Interfacing with databases using dplyr focuses on retrieving and analyzing datasets by generating SELECT SQL statements, but it doesn't modify the database itself. dplyr does not offer functions to UPDATE or DELETE entries. If you need these functionalities, you will need to use additional R packages (e.g., RSQLite). \n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Structured Query Language (SQL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is the most widely deployed database in the world. It is included on Android, iPhone and IOS devices and in Firefox, Chrome and Safari web browsers. Apple and Microsoft include it in their OSX and Windows 10 operating systems respectively and there are many other products that include SQLite. It is extremely easy to use, and can be of great value to developers who need a database available but want to avoid the overhead often associated with installing and configuring an external database. In this demonstration, we will download and install the RSQLite package which will integrate SQLite into R running in RStudio. \n",

Forward-thinking organizations can now use databases to go beyond basic data storage and transactions to analyze vast quantities of data from multiple systems. Using database and other computing and business intelligence tools, organizations can now leverage the data they collect to run more efficiently, enable better decision-making, and become more agile and scalable. By having direct control over the ability to create and use databases, users gain control and autonomy while still maintaining important security standards."
